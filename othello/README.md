# Othello / Reversi

### Goal
End the game with more of your pieces than your opponent.

### Rules
Each Player plays either the Black or White pieces. Players take turn moving pieces, if a play does not have a move then it is the next players turn. 
For each turn, a player must place a piece of their color on one of the empty cells on the board, adjacent to an opponent's piece. In addition, there must be a line of opponent pieces to any other piece owned by the player. The discs are not removed from the board but flipped over such that the player now owns these pieces.
